**Title:** Disaster Tweet Sentiment Classification with DistilBERT Fine-tuning

**Description:**

This repository contains a Colab notebook for training a DistilBERT model to classify sentiment in disaster tweets. It covers the following steps:

1. **Loading Disaster Tweets:** Explains the data source and loading process.
2. **Data Exploration:** Describes the data analysis performed.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Details the preprocessing steps applied to the data.
4. **DistilBERT Model Loading:** Explains how the DistilBERT model is loaded from Keras NLP.
5. **Fine-tuning DistilBERT:** Describes the training process for fine-tuning the DistilBERT model.
6. **Submission File Generation:** Explains how the predicted sentiment labels are generated for unseen data.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Provide instructions on cloning the repository using `git clone`.
2. **Install Dependencies:** List any required libraries or dependencies needed to run the notebook. You can use `!pip install <library_name>` commands within the notebook.
3. **Run the Notebook:** Explain how to access and run the Colab notebook. 

**Additional Information:**

* **Dataset:** If you're using a public dataset, mention its source.
* **DistilBERT Model:** Specify the specific DistilBERT model you used.
